# Chart-forecast

Second version of wether-forecast project using the charts.js library and the bootstrap framework features. It was my one of the first connections of external libraries to the project. Discovering the new features contained in the documentation and the complexity of the problems I encountered gave me a lot of fun. \
The project has many errors, it has never been completed.
